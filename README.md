### <div align='center' ><font size='70'>Single cell RNA Sequencing Identifies G-protein Coupled Receptor 87 as a Novel Basal Cell Marker of Distal Honeycomb Cysts in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis </font></div>

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating and life-threatening lung disease characterized by epithelial reprogramming and increased extracellular matrix deposition leading to loss of lung function. A prominent histopathological structure in the distal IPF lung include honeycomb cysts in the alveolar space [1]. These are heterogeneous bronchiolized areas that feature clusters of simple epithelium with Keratin (KRT)5+ basal-like cells interspersed with pseudostratified epithelium containing differentiated, hyperplastic epithelial cells as well as aberrant ciliated cells [2-5]. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies of the lung epithelium shed further light into cellular subtypes unique to IPF, including basaloid KRT5-/KRT17+ cells present in the distal lung [6-9]. However, IPF distal bronchiole KRT5+ basal cell subtypes still remain poorly characterized and their disease contribution remains under-investigated. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched EpCAM+ lung cells of the distal IPF lung, we identified G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 87, as a novel marker of distal bronchioles and KRT5+ IPF basal cells contributing to impaired airway differentiation and honeycombing.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
