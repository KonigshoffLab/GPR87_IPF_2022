### <div align='center' ><font size='70'>Single cell RNA Sequencing Identifies G-protein Coupled Receptor 87 as a Novel Basal Cell Marker of Distal Honeycomb Cysts in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis </font></div>

<p align = "justify"> 
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating and life-threatening lung disease characterized by epithelial reprogramming and increased extracellular matrix deposition leading to loss of lung function. A prominent histopathological structure in the distal IPF lung include honeycomb cysts in the alveolar space. These are heterogeneous bronchiolized areas that feature clusters of simple epithelium with Keratin (KRT)5<sup>+</sup> basal-like cells interspersed with pseudostratified epithelium containing differentiated, hyperplastic epithelial cells as well as aberrant ciliated cells. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies of the lung epithelium shed further light into cellular subtypes unique to IPF, including basaloid KRT5<sup>-</sup>/KRT17<sup>+</sup> cells present in the distal lung. However, IPF distal bronchiole KRT5<sup>+</sup> basal cell subtypes still remain poorly characterized and their disease contribution remains under-investigated. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of enriched EpCAM<sup>+</sup> lung cells of the distal IPF lung, we identified G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 87, as a novel marker of distal bronchioles and KRT5<sup>+</sup> IPF basal cells contributing to impaired airway differentiation and honeycombing.
